## Desktop Environment?

Yes, we finally had our wifi working with proxmox host. Although its not reliable some websites dns is not resolved, cannot passthrough wifi to vms, but i have a router which have WWAN support i can use that as a portable wifi to ethernet converter if i really need portability. Our Proxmox is equipped with KDE-Plasma this time and now is the only operating system i have, no more windows, garuda or dual booting. We have bounded ourself to proxmox only. Everything that has to be done is to be done here itself.
