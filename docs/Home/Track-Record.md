#### Web Specific


### July

I have devoted this month to prepare to get into college, so had a little bit fun with friends and got lazy as hell thinking to compensate for it later in the college hours, thoughts were like, will engineers get enough sleep? Answer to this question varies with time and experience. 

Projects that were done here is obsidian.

#### Obsidian

1. [Second Brain Template 2023]

This is the vault that has been updated and being re-wrote from scratch to work with the current requirements. All the templates have been updated and published in order to act as a building block of other personal knowledge management projects.

#### Oneplus 

This was my production setup for the July month. You can view that [here](../Developement-Setup/Owned-Devices/Android/One-Plus/Kebab/Production/2023/July/production.md)

### August

Yes, finally college routine is in action. Now we have a room (P.G.) in which we are going to do all server related stuff for perhaps the next 4 years or so. My setup walkthrough will be linked here accordingly once it's ready.

### September-November 

College and other stuff made me forgot what i did and wasn't able to document the changes. 

### December 

We shifted to a 2-BHK flat on a contract till May 2024. Now we have a proper studio/study room. 

- We successfully implemented pfsense plus we got a tenda router which has a wan port, which theoretically mean we can have an AP for pfsense aswell. So its awesome. 


## 2024

I am not including the maintenance of this knowledge base as a track record because the actual task sometimes takes about 5 minutes to complete, but in order to document it the time investment slows the progress of the project down. I would consider this as my dedicated contribution to make knowledge[^2] open source and free of cost.   

## January

### General

- Migration from manjaro to garuda is done.
- Updated Second Brain Tools to final release.
- Deployed IP allocation rules.

### Proxmox
