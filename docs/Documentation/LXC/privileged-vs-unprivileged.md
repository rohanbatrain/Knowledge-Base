# Differentiating both


|                        | Privileged Containers                                        | Unprivileged Containers                                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Container Type**      | Elevated privileges, shares host kernel.                     | Restricted access, runs with separate user namespace.        |
| **Full System Access**  | Yes                                                          | No                                                           |
| **Kernel Capabilities** | Inherits host kernel capabilities.                            | Reduced capabilities for certain privileged operations.     |
| **Security Implications**| May pose security risks if not configured properly.          | Considered more secure; limited impact on host if compromised.|
| **User Namespace**      | No                                                           | Yes (isolated user namespace).                                |

**Choosing Between Privileged and Unprivileged Containers:**
- Consider specific application requirements and desired security levels.
- Recommended to use unprivileged containers for enhanced security and isolation.
